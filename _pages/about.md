<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

My name is Chuan Tian. I’m currently a master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I’ve worked as a Research intern in the Computational Approaches and Message Effects Research Group ([CAMER](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/camer/)) at UW–Madison, and as a Software Engineer intern at Baixing, a listed tech company in China.

My current interests lie in LLM applications, Emerging Media Technologies, and AI-generated content. Inspired by how AI is shaping communication and creativity, I’m exploring new ways of interaction between humans and machines.

In my free time, I enjoy brewing coffee, capturing travel moments through photography, and snowboarding.
